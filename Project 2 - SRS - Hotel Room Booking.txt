Project: Hotel Room Booking System

Calculate the cost based on the number of nights and room type for hotel room bookings.

BR001: $100 per night for standard rooms.
BR002: $150 per night for deluxe rooms.
BR003: $200 per night for suites.

Apply discounts based on the length of stay:
BR004: 10% discount for bookings of 3 or more consecutive nights.
BR005: 15% discount for bookings of 7 or more consecutive nights.
BR006: No additional discounts for bookings of fewer than 3 nights.
BR007: Max 30 Night

Determine the total cost by multiplying the base price per night with the 
number of nights and applying any applicable discounts.
